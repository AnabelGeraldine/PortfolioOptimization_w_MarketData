# PortfolioOptimization_w_MarketData

This project explores portfolio optimization strategies to maximize returns while minimizing risk using real-world market data. By applying Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Utility Theory, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the study aims to determine the optimal allocation of assets based on risk tolerance and market conditions. The focus is on constructing both static and dynamic portfolios, evaluating their efficiency in different financial scenarios.

The analysis involved parameter estimation, where asset returns and covariances were computed using market data from different periods. Static portfolio optimization was performed by solving for asset weights that maximize investor utility and minimize variance while meeting return constraints. Additionally, an efficient frontier was constructed to identify optimal portfolios with a 6% return target. Dynamic portfolio optimization introduced adaptive strategies, where portfolio weights were adjusted over time using a Finite Markov Decision Process and Monte Carlo simulations to balance risk and reward.

The results revealed that static portfolios generally outperformed dynamic portfolios in stable market conditions, providing higher returns at lower risk. However, dynamic strategies were more effective in adjusting to market changes, ensuring better risk management over time. Further analysis included varying risk aversion levels and incorporating new asset classes (ILE_UH), which enhanced diversification and improved portfolio resilience. These findings highlight the importance of robust parameter estimation and model flexibility in financial decision-making, providing valuable insights for constructing optimized investment strategies.
